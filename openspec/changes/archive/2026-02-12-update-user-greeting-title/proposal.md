## Why

The User Info page currently displays "User Info" as its heading, which is generic and uninviting. Changing it to "Greetings!" better reflects the friendly, personalized nature of the greeting content displayed on the page and improves the user experience.

## What Changes

- Update the page heading on the User Info page from "User Info" to "Greetings!"
- Change the title text in `src/web/src/pages/UserInfoPage.tsx`

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
<!-- None - this is a UI text update only -->

### Modified Capabilities
- `ui-user-info`: Update page heading text from "User Info" to "Greetings!"

## Impact

- **Affected Code**: `src/web/src/pages/UserInfoPage.tsx` (UserInfoPage component)
- **Affected Users**: All users viewing their user profile information
- **Breaking Changes**: None - this is a non-breaking UI text change
- **Dependencies**: None
